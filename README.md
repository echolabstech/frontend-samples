Found list of countries by climate from the [cia's website](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/284.html), and countries Chinese citizens can enter without visa from the [henley passport index website](https://www.henleypassportindex.com/passport), which has a public facing [API](https://www.henleypassportindex.com/fetch?entity=regions&code=CN&is_visa_free=1&url=passports%2FCN%2Fcountries). Filter countries by climate, visa free, and matching target per-capita income. [Per-capita income](https://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/median-income-by-country/) for countries around the world from OECD data set. Use the world bank [LPI scoring system](https://lpi.worldbank.org/international/global?sort=asc&order=Infrastructure#datatable) to filter countries by overall infrastructure investment and development. There is [another table](http://reports.weforum.org/global-competitiveness-index-2017-2018/competitiveness-rankings/#series=GCI.A.02.02) from the world economic forum (weforum) which allows you to drill down into overall infrastructure into electricity and telephony, but I found the world banks easier to extract information from. I was able to get a couple json files from weforum: [ranks](http://data-visualization-app-qa.herokuapp.com/api/v1/index_edition_data_last_n?indexId=GCI&seriesId=GCI.A.02.02&last=7) and [definitions](http://data-visualization-app-qa.herokuapp.com/api/v1/data_dictionary) used to lookup ranks by country 3 letter code.
